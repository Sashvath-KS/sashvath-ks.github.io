I am Sashvath, a second year BS-MS student at IISER Mohali. This site is where I collect the things I tinker with, think about, and explain.

## My interests

I’m someone who gets excited by ideas that reduce complexity: a well-chosen approximation, a clever experiment, or an elegant argument. For me, physics isn’t just a set of facts but an operating system which provides a set of tools and a way of thinking.

The kinds of questions I like circling around are simple but fundamental. For instance in physical systems, how local rules grow into global patterns, how to create a model using the empirical results as axioms, and what experimental tricks can expose something hidden.

I don’t have a fixed field that I work in yet. I’m exploring widely and following what feels rewarding to reason about.

## Other things I do

I play Carnatic music on a keyboard and listen to a wide mix of music. I take long, walks to think, I tinker with small electronics, and I occasionally disappear into a good video game. I also take part in clubs and campus activities mostly because they’re a convenient excuse to try something new :)
